# Prerequisites

- **Troubleshooting & FAQs**: Troubleshoot common error scenarios and find answers to frequently asked questions about Web Standard Checkout Integration.

You can start accepting payments from customers on your website using the Razorpay Web Standard Checkout. Razorpay has developed the Standard Checkout method and manages it. You can configure payment methods, orders, company logo and also select custom colour based on your convenience. 

 **WARN**

 
 **Watch Out!**
 
 Razorpay Checkout is not supported on the Internet Explorer browser.
 

  
   Check the list of features Razorpay offers to help you build a world-class payment experience.
  
 
  - **Video Tutorial**: Watch this video to know how to integrate Razorpay Web Standard Checkout on your HTML and JS-based website.

## Client Libraries

The client SDK libraries are available on GitHub. You can use the API keys generated above to try out the API sample codes:

  
    - **Integrate**: 
    

    - **GitHub Repo**: 
    

## Integration Steps

**Before you proceed:**
         

- Create a [Razorpay account](https://dashboard.razorpay.com/signup). 

- Generate the [API Keys](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) from the Dashboard. To go live with the integration and start accepting real payments, generate Live Mode API Keys and replace them in the integration.

Follow these integration steps:

  - **1. Build Integration**: Integrate Web Standard Checkout.

  - **2. Test Integration**: Test the integration by making a test payment.

  - **3. Go-live Checklist**: Check the go-live checklist.

 **INFO**

 
 **Other Solutions**
 
 - If you use  WordPress, Magento, WooCommerce, Shopify and other **ecommerce platforms** for your platform, use our [ecommerce plugins](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/ecommerce-plugins.md).
 
 - You can use [Razorpay Custom Checkout](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/custom.md) to gain control over the checkout experience. Custom Checkout integration is more complex than Standard Checkout integration and you will require a development team on your end to complete the integration. 
 
 
 - Need a **Pay** button without doing any integration? Use [Razorpay Payment Button](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-button.md).

# Integration Steps

Follow these steps to integrate the Standard Checkout form on your website:

  - **1. Build Integration**: Integrate Web Standard Checkout.

  - **2. Test Integration**: Test the integration by making a test payment.

  - **3. Go-live Checklist**: Check the go-live checklist.

## 1. Build Integration

Follow the steps given below:

    
### 1.1 Create an Order in Server

         Given below are the order states and the corresponding payment states:

         

         Payment Stages | Order State | Payment State | Description
         ---
         Stage I | created | created | The customer submits the payment information, which is sent to Razorpay. The payment is **not processed** at this stage.
         ---
         Stage II | attempted | authorized/failed | An order moves from **created** to **attempted** state when payment is first attempted. It remains in this state until a payment associated with the order is captured.
         ---
         Stage III | paid | captured | After the payment moves to the **captured** state, the order moves to the **paid** state. - No more payment requests are allowed after an order moves to the **paid** state. 
-  The order continues to be in this state even if the payment for this order is **refunded**.

         

         
> **INFO**
>
> 
>          **Capture Payments Automatically**
> 
>          You can capture payments automatically with the one-time [Payment Capture setting configuration](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/capture-settings.md) on the Dashboard.
>          

         **Order is an important step in the payment process.**

- An order should be created for every payment.
- You can create an order using the [Orders API](#api-sample-code). It is a server-side API call. Know how to [authenticate](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) Orders API.
- The `order_id` received in the response should be passed to the checkout. This ties the order with the payment and secures the request from being tampered.

> **WARN**
>
> 
> **Watch Out!**
> 
> Payments made without an `order_id` cannot be captured and will be automatically refunded. You must create an order before initiating payments to ensure proper payment processing.
> 

You can create an order using:

    
        Use this endpoint to create an order using the Orders API.

### 1.2.4 Errors

                 Given below is a list of errors you may face while integrating with checkout on the client-side.

                 

                 Error | Cause | Solution
                 ---
                 The id provided does not exist. | Occurs when there is a mismatch between the API keys used while creating the `order_id`/`customer_id` and the API key passed in the checkout. | Make sure that the API keys passed in the checkout are the same as the API keys used while creating the `order_id`/`customer_id`.
                 ---
                 Blocked by CORS policy. | Occurs when the server-to-server request is hit from the front end instead. | Make sure that the API calls are made from the server side and not the client side.
                 
                

            
            
### 1.2.5 Configure Payment Methods *(Optional)*

                 Multiple payment methods are available on the Razorpay Web Standard Checkout.
                 - The payment methods are **fixed** and cannot be changed.
                 - You can configure the order or make certain payment methods prominent. Know more about [configuring payment methods](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/configure-payment-methods.md).
                 

            
         
        
    
    
### 1.3 Handle Payment Success and Failure

         The way the Payment Success and Failure scenarios are handled depends on the [Checkout Sample Code](#122-code-to-add-pay-button) you used in the last step.

         ### Checkout with Handler Function

         If you used the sample code with the handler function:

         
             
                 #### On Payment Success

                 The customer sees your website page. The checkout returns the response object of the successful payment (**razorpay_payment_id**, **razorpay_order_id** and **razorpay_signature**). Collect these and send them to your server.
             

             

                 #### On Payment Failure

                 The customer is notified about payment failure and asked to retry the payment. Know about the [error parameters.](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/errors.md#response-parameters)
                     ```js: Failure Handling Code
                     rzp1.on('payment.failed', function (response){
                         alert(response.error.code);
                         alert(response.error.description);
                         alert(response.error.source);
                         alert(response.error.step);
                         alert(response.error.reason);
                         alert(response.error.metadata.order_id);
                         alert(response.error.metadata.payment_id);
                     }
                     ```
             
         
         ### Checkout with Callback URL

         If you used the sample code with the callback URL:

         
             
                 #### On Payment Success 

                 Razorpay makes a POST call to the callback URL with the **razorpay_payment_id**, **razorpay_order_id** and **razorpay_signature** in the response object of the successful payment. Only successful authorisations are auto-submitted.
             
             
                 #### On Payment Failure

                 In case of failed payments, the checkout is displayed again to facilitate payment retry.
             
         
        

    
### 1.4 Store Fields in Your Server

         A successful payment returns the following fields to the Checkout form.

  
    Success Callback
    
- You need to store these fields in your server.
- You can confirm the authenticity of these details by verifying the signature in the next step.

```json: Success Callback
{
  "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_29QQoUBi66xm2f",
  "razorpay_order_id": "order_9A33XWu170gUtm",
  "razorpay_signature": "9ef4dffbfd84f1318f6739a3ce19f9d85851857ae648f114332d8401e0949a3d"
}
```

`razorpay_payment_id`
: `string` Unique identifier for the payment returned by Checkout **only** for successful payments.

`razorpay_order_id`
: `string` Unique identifier for the order returned by Checkout.

`razorpay_signature`
: `string` Signature returned by the Checkout. This is used to verify the payment.
    

        
    
    
### 1.5 Verify Payment Signature

         This is a mandatory step to confirm the authenticity of the details returned to the Checkout form for successful payments.

  
    To verify the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form:
    
     1. Create a signature in your server using the following attributes:
        - `order_id`: Retrieve the `order_id` from your server. Do not use the `razorpay_order_id` returned by Checkout.
        - `razorpay_payment_id`: Returned by Checkout.
        - `key_secret`: Available in your server. The `key_secret` that was generated from the [Dashboard](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys).

     2. Use the SHA256 algorithm, the `razorpay_payment_id` and the `order_id` to construct a HMAC hex digest as shown below:

         ```html: HMAC Hex Digest
         generated_signature = hmac_sha256(order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id, secret);

           if (generated_signature == razorpay_signature) {
             payment is successful
           }
         ```
         
     3. If the signature you generate on your server matches the `razorpay_signature` returned to you by the Checkout form, the payment received is from an authentic source.
    

  
### Generate Signature on Your Server

Given below is the sample code for payment signature verification:

```java: Java
RazorpayClient razorpay = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

String secret = "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";

JSONObject options = new JSONObject();
options.put("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3");
options.put("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.put("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f");

boolean status =  Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options, secret);

```php: PHP
$api = new Api($key_id, $secret);

$api->utility->verifyPaymentSignature(array('razorpay_order_id' => $razorpayOrderId, 'razorpay_payment_id' => $razorpayPaymentId, 'razorpay_signature' => $razorpaySignature));

```ruby: Ruby
require "razorpay"
Razorpay.setup('YOUR_KEY_ID', 'YOUR_SECRET')

payment_response = {
       razorpay_order_id: 'order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3',
       razorpay_payment_id: 'pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l',
       razorpay_signature: '0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f'
     }
Razorpay::Utility.verify_payment_signature(payment_response)

```python: Python
import razorpay
client = razorpay.Client(auth=("YOUR_ID", "YOUR_SECRET"))

client.utility.verify_payment_signature({
  'razorpay_order_id': razorpay_order_id,
  'razorpay_payment_id': razorpay_payment_id,
  'razorpay_signature': razorpay_signature
  })

```c: .NET
RazorpayClient client = new RazorpayClient("[YOUR_KEY_ID]", "[YOUR_KEY_SECRET]");

Dictionary options = new Dictionary();
options.Add("razorpay_order_id", "order_IEIaMR65");
options.Add("razorpay_payment_id", "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l");
options.Add("razorpay_signature", "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50");

Utils.verifyPaymentSignature(options);

```nodejs: Node.js
var instance = new Razorpay({ key_id: 'YOUR_KEY_ID', key_secret: 'YOUR_SECRET' })

var { validatePaymentVerification, validateWebhookSignature } = require('./dist/utils/razorpay-utils');
validatePaymentVerification({"order_id": razorpayOrderId, "payment_id": razorpayPaymentId }, signature, secret);

```Go: Go
import ( razorpay "github.com/razorpay/razorpay-go" )
client := razorpay.NewClient("YOUR_KEY_ID", "YOUR_SECRET")

params := map[string]interface{}{
 "razorpay_order_id": "order_IEIaMR65cu6nz3",
 "razorpay_payment_id": "pay_IH4NVgf4Dreq1l",
}

signature := "0d4e745a1838664ad6c9c9902212a32d627d68e917290b0ad5f08ff4561bc50f";
secret := "EnLs21M47BllR3X8PSFtjtbd";
utils.VerifyPaymentSignature(params, signature, secret)
```

    

  
### Post Signature Verification

After you have completed the integration, you can [set up webhooks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md), make test payments, replace the test key with the live key and integrate with other [APIs](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api.md).
    

         

         Here are the links to our [SDKs](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard.md#client-libraries) for the supported platforms.
         
        
    
    
### 1.6 Verify Payment Status

         
> **INFO**
>
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> On the Razorpay Dashboard, ensure that the payment status is `captured`. Refer to the payment capture settings page to know how to [capture payments automatically](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/capture-settings.md).
> 

    
        You can track the payment status in three ways:
        

    
        To verify the payment status from the Razorpay Dashboard:

        1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and navigate to **Transactions** → **Payments**.
        2. Check if a **Payment Id** has been generated and note the status. In case of a successful payment, the status is marked as **Captured**.
        
    
    
        You can use Razorpay webhooks to configure and receive notifications when a specific event occurs. When one of these events is triggered, we send an HTTP POST payload in JSON to the webhook's configured URL. Know how to [set up webhooks.](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md)

        #### Example
        If you have subscribed to the `order.paid` webhook event, you will receive a notification every time a customer pays you for an order.
    
    
        [Poll Payment APIs](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/fetch-all-payments.md) to check the payment status.
    

        

        
    

## 2. Test Integration

After the integration is complete, a **Pay** button appears on your webpage/app. 

Click the button and make a test transaction to ensure the integration is working as expected. You can start accepting actual payments from your customers once the test transaction is successful.

**WARN**

 
**Watch Out!**

This is a mock payment page that uses your test API keys, test card and payment details. 
- Ensure you have entered only your [Test Mode API keys](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys.md#generate-api-keys) in the Checkout code. 
- Test mode features a mock bank page with **Success** and **Failure** buttons to replicate the live payment experience.
- No real money is deducted due to the usage of test API keys. This is a simulated transaction.
 

Following are all the payment modes that the customer can use to complete the payment on the Checkout. Some of them are available by default, while others may require approval from us. Raise a request from the Dashboard to enable such payment methods.

You can make test payments using one of the payment methods configured at the Checkout.

    
### Netbanking

         You can select any of the listed banks. After choosing a bank, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment `success` or a `failure`. Since this is Test Mode, we will not redirect you to the bank login portals.

         Check the list of [supported banks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/netbanking.md#supported-banks).

         You can enter one of the following UPI IDs:

         - `success@razorpay`: To make the payment successful. 
         - `failure@razorpay`: To fail the payment.

         Check the list of [supported UPI flows](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/upi.md).

         
**INFO**


        **Handy Tips**

        You can use **Test Mode** to test UPI payments, and **Live Mode** for UPI Intent and QR payments.
         

        

    
### Cards

         You can use the following test cards to test transactions for your integration in Test Mode.

         ### Domestic Cards

         Use the following test cards for Indian payments:

         
         Network | Card Number | CVV & Expiry Date
         ---
         Visa  | 4100 2800 0000 1007 | Use a random CVV and any future date ^^^^^
         ---
         Mastercard | 5500 6700 0000 1002 | 
         ---
         RuPay | 6527 6589 0000 1005 | 
         ---
         Diners | 3608 280009 1007 | 
         ---
         Amex | 3402 560004 01007 | 
         

         #### Error Scenarios

         Use these test cards to simulate payment errors. See the [complete list](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/test-card-details.md#error-scenario-test-cards) of error test cards with detailed scenarios.
         Check the following lists: 
         - [Supported Card Networks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/cards.md).
         - [Cards Error Codes](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/errors/payments/cards.md).

         ### International Cards

         Use the following test cards to test international payments. Use any valid expiration date in the future in the MM/YY format and any random CVV to create a successful payment.

         
         Card Network | Card Number | CVV & Expiry Date
         ---
         Mastercard | 5555 5555 5555 4444
5105 1051 0510 5100
5104 0600 0000 0008 | Use a random CVV and any future date ^^
         ---
         Visa | 4012 8888 8888 1881 |
         

         Check the list of [supported card networks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/cards.md).
        

    
### Wallet

         You can select any of the listed wallets. After choosing a wallet, Razorpay will redirect to a mock page where you can make the payment `success` or a `failure`. Since this is Test Mode, we will not redirect you to the wallet login portals.

         Check the list of [supported wallets](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/wallets.md#supported-wallets).
        

## 3. Go-live Checklist

Check the go-live checklist for Razorpay Web Standard Checkout integration. Consider these steps before taking the integration live.

    
### 3.1 Accept Live Payments

         Perform an end-to-end simulation of funds flow in the Test Mode. Once confident that the integration is working as expected, switch to the Live Mode and start accepting payments from customers.

**WARN**

**Watch Out!**

Ensure you are switching your test API keys with API keys generated in Live Mode.


To generate API Keys in Live Mode on your Razorpay Dashboard:

1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and switch to **Live Mode** on the menu.
1. Navigate to **Account & Settings** → **API Keys** → **Generate Key** to generate the API Key for Live Mode.
1. Download the keys and save them securely.
1. Replace the Test API Key with the Live Key in the Checkout code and start accepting actual payments.

        

    
### 3.2 Payment Capture

         After payment is `authorized`, you need to capture it to settle the amount to your bank account as per the settlement schedule. Payments that are not captured are auto-refunded after a fixed time.

**WARN**

**Watch Out**

- You should deliver the products or services to your customers only after the payment is captured. Razorpay automatically refunds all the uncaptured payments.
 - You can track the payment status using our [Fetch a Payment API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments.md#fetch-a-payment) or webhooks.


  
    Authorized payments can be automatically captured. You can auto-capture all payments [using global settings](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/capture-settings.md#auto-capture-all-payments) on the Razorpay Dashboard. Know more about [capture settings for payments](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/capture-settings.md).

    
**WARN**


   **Watch Out!**
    Payment capture settings work only if you have integrated with Orders API on your server side. Know more about the [Orders API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/orders/create.md).
    

  
  
    Each authorized payment can also be captured individually. You can manually capture payments using [Payment Capture API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments.md#capture-a-payment) or [Dashboard](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/dashboard.md#manually-capture-payments). Know more about [capture settings for payments](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/capture-settings.md).
  

        

    
### 3.3 Set Up Webhooks

         Ensure you have [set up webhooks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md) in the live mode and configured the events for which you want to receive notifications.

         
**WARN**
        **Implementation Considerations**
          Webhooks are the primary and most efficient method for event notifications. They are delivered asynchronously in near real-time. For critical user-facing flows that need instant confirmation (like showing "Payment Successful" immediately), supplement webhooks with API verification.

 **Recommended approach** 

         - Rely on webhooks for all automation, which can be asynchronous.
         - If a critical user-facing flow requires instant status, but the webhook notification has not arrived within the time mandated by your business needs, perform an immediate API Fetch call ([Payments](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/fetch-with-id.md), [Orders](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/orders/fetch-with-id.md) and [Refunds](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/refunds/fetch-specific-refund-payment.md)) to verify the status.
         

        

 Dashboard:

1. Log in to the Razorpay Dashboard and switch to **Live Mode** on the menu.
1. Navigate to **Account & Settings** → **API Keys** → **Generate Key** to generate the API Key for Live Mode.
1. Download the keys and save them securely.
1. Replace the Test API Key with the Live Key in the Checkout code and start accepting actual payments.

        
    
    
### 3.2 Set Up Webhooks

         Ensure you have [set up webhooks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md) in the live mode and configured the events for which you want to receive notifications.

         
**WARN**

# About Payment Methods Configuration

You can configure the payment methods of your choice on the Razorpay Checkout to provide a highly personalised experience for your customers. This provides a simple and accessible experience to your customers increasing your sales and your success rates.

  
 

## Use Cases

Depending on the use cases that you might have, Razorpay allows you to create any configuration of the payment methods, of your choice:

- **Highlighting certain payment instruments on the Checkout.** For example, **Google Pay** could be displayed outside the UPI block as a separate payment method. **HDFC Netbanking** could come out of the Netbanking container as a different payment method.

- **Restricting the kind of network, issuer, BIN and card type, different card properties, to accept payments.** For example, you can choose to accept payments only from **HDFC Visa Debit cards** on the Checkout.

- **Removing a certain payment method or instrument.** For example, any wallet can be removed as a payment instrument from wallets. The entire **Netbanking** block or a certain bank in Netbanking can be removed from the Checkout.

- **Reordering of payment methods on the Checkout.** You can choose to arrange **UPI** as the first section instead of **Cards** on the Checkout. You can again order the PSPs within the UPI block according to your need.

- **Grouping of payment instruments.** For example, you can choose to group **Netbanking** and **UPI** payment methods of a bank as a block that will be labelled as **Pay via Bank** on the Checkout.

## Configuring Payment Methods

To control payment methods on the Checkout, there are different ways to pass the configuration to the Checkout:

- **Configure via Dashboard**: Choose the payment methods and instruments you want to display at checkout, arrange them in your preferred order, and tailor the checkout experience to match your business needs. Create custom payment blocks for specific customer segments on the Razorpay Dashboard. Know more about [Payment Configuration](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/payment-configuration.md).

- **Pass Configuration at Runtime**: Pass the configuration to the `options` parameter of the Checkout code at the run time.  This is useful when you want to modify the order of the payment methods for a particular set of payments while rendering the Checkout. See the [Sample Code](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/configure-payment-methods/sample-code.md) for details.

- **Use a Configuration ID**: Create a global setting of the payments as a **Configuration ID** and pass these values while creating the Order. This is useful when you want control the checkout configurations dynamically using different **Configuration IDs**. You can create a **Configuration ID** through the [Dashboard](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/payment-configuration.md). There are two ways to pass the Configuration ID:
  - While creating the order: Add the `checkout_config_id` field in the order creation request.
  - While opening the checkout: Include the `checkout_config_id` in the checkout options.

  ```json: Pass config id
  "checkout_config_id": "YourConfigIDHere"
  ```

# Understand the Configuration

Let us understand the building blocks that are required to build a configuration of your choice:

1. [Payment Methods](#payment-methods)
2. [Payment Instruments](#payment-instruments)
3. [Blocks](#blocks)
4. [Sequence](#sequence)
5. [Preferences](#preferences)

## Payment Methods

Before deciding the payment methods or payment instruments that you want to configure on the Checkout, refer to the [payment methods](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods.md) supported by Razorpay.

## Payment Instruments

A payment instrument is a combination of the payment method and its associated properties. For example, a payment instrument can be an **AXIS Debit card**, where **card** is the payment method and the issuer (AXIS bank) is the associated **instrument**.

An instrument is a JSON object with a key named `method`. Each method and its associated properties are described in the sections below:

### Card

### Pay Later

For the  method: `paylater`, the payment instruments are listed below:

Name | Type | Description | Values | Examples
---
providers | string | Providers to be allowed | [Any paylater provider](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/configure-payment-methods/supported-methods.md#supported-paylater-providers) | `providers: ["hdfc"]`

### Apps

For the method `app`, the payment instrument is listed below:

Name | Type | Description | Values | Examples
---
providers | string | Providers to be allowed | [Any app provider](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/configure-payment-methods/supported-methods.md#supported-apps) | `providers: ["cred"]`

```js: JavaScript
// beginning of the code
....
{
  "custom": {
    "name": "Pay with Apps",
    "instruments": [
      {
        "method": "app",
        "providers": [
          "cred"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
...
//rest of the code
```

## Blocks

A block is a collection of one or more payment instruments. Each block has a `name` and `code` associated as shown below:

```js: JavaScript
// Block creation
let myPayments = {
  name: "My Custom Block",
  instruments: ["gpay"]
};
// Usage in config
let config = {
  display: {
    blocks: {
      highlighted: myPayments
    }
  }
};
```

Here, `highlighted` is the code associated with `myPayments`. Multiple blocks can be added to the config at the same time.

## Sequence

You can specify the `sequence`, that is the order, in which the payment methods should be displayed on the Checkout.

A sequence is an `array` of strings, where each string is the name of the payment method or a `block`.

In a sequence, you can include any block using the `block.${code}` format. The block with code **highlighted** should be represented as `block.highlighted` as shown below:

```js: JavaScript
let sequence = ["block.highlighted", "upi", "netbanking"];
```

The above sequence will place the code `highlighted` first followed by the payment methods `upi` and `netbanking` in that particular order.

> **INFO**
>
> 
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> Every block defined has to be present in the sequence. If you do not wish to reorder the methods and want to place your block, the sequence should contain `block.highlighted` with just one item in it.
> 

## Preferences

Using the `preferences` object, you can enhance the configuration of the Checkout. By setting this value, you can decide whether the default list of payment methods should be displayed or not.

Possible values are:

`true`
: Checkout will display the sequence of the payment methods configured by you alongside with the default order of payment methods available in the Checkout.

`false`
: Checkout will only show the sequence of the payment methods configured by you.

## Hide Payment Instruments

You can also hide or remove certain instruments from the Checkout.

This is an `array` containing the `method` key used to hide either the payment method and/or the payment instrument associated with that payment method. For example, you can hide the methods, `card` and `HDFC netbanking` on the Checkout.

```js: JavaScript
let cardInstrument = {
  method: "card"
};

let instrumentOfSomeBank = {
  method: "netbanking",
  banks: ["HDFC"]
};

let hiddenInstruments = [cardInstrument, instrumentOfSomeBank];
```

This is an `array` containing the `method` key used to hide either the payment method and/or the payment instrument associated with that payment method. For example, you can hide the methods, `card` and `Axis netbanking` on the Checkout.

```js: JavaScript
let cardInstrument = {
  method: "card"
};

let instrumentOfSomeBank = {
  method: "netbanking",
  banks: ["UTIB"]
};

let hiddenInstruments = [cardInstrument, instrumentOfSomeBank];
```

> **INFO**
>
> 
> 
> **Handy Tips**
> 
> Hiding any instrument using `hide` does not affect the similar instrument defined in `blocks`. So, if you want to hide `UTIB` bank from `netbanking` and have defined the same instrument in one of your blocks, Axis bank will still be displayed in that block.

# Display the Configuration

The `display` configuration can be passed in the Checkout options.

You can use the `display` configuration to put together all the modules, that is, `blocks`, `sequence`, `preferences`, and `hide` instruments as shown below:

```js: display configuration
let config = {
  display: {
    blocks: {
      code: {
        name: "The name of the block", // The title of the block
        instruments: [instrument, instrument] // The list of instruments
      },

      anotherCode: {
        name: "Another block",
        instruments: [instrument]
      }
    },

    hide: [
      {
        method: "method"
      }
    ],

    sequence: ["block.code"], // The sequence in which blocks and methods should be shown

    preferences: {
      show_default_blocks: true // Should Checkout show its default blocks?
    }
  }
};

```js: JavaScript Checkout options
// beginning of the Checkout code
.....

let options = {
  key: "[YOUR_KEY_ID]",
  amount: 60000,
  currency: "INR",

  config: {
    display: {
      // The display config
    }
  }
};

let razorpay = new Razorpay(options);

razorpay.open();
....
//rest of the Checkout code

```

# Best Practices for Standard Checkout Integration

Follow the best practices for a smooth Standard Checkout web integration.

1. **Capture Payment Using Payment Capture Settings**

    You **must capture** the authorised payments for the **settlement of the payments** in your bank account. Use the [Payment Capture Setting](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payments/capture-settings.md) to configure the capture settings at an account level via the Dashboard.

2. **Integrate Orders API**

    Orders bind multiple payment attempts for a single order. This helps to **prevent multiple payments**. [Integrate with Orders API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/integration-steps.md#11-create-an-order-in-server) on your server-side and pass the `order_id` to Checkout.

3. **Verify Signature to Avoid Data Tampering**

    This is a mandatory step to confirm the authenticity of the details returned to the Checkout form for successful payments. Know how to [verify payment signature](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/integration-steps.md#15-verify-payment-signature).

4. **Check Payment/Order Status before Providing Services**

    Check the payment/order status, that is if the payment's status is `captured` and the order's status is `paid` before proving the services to the customers.

    - [Fetch All Payments for an Order API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/orders/fetch-payments.md)
    - [Fetch Status of a Payment using Payment id API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/payments/fetch-with-id.md)
    - [Fetch Status of an Order using Order id API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/api/orders/fetch-with-id.md)

5. **Implement Webhooks**

    Implement webhooks or the query API to avoid callback failure (drop-offs could be due to connectivity or network failure) and to verify the payment details via an S2S call. Know more about [Webhooks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/webhooks/setup-edit-payments.md). You should enable the following webhooks:

    - `payment.captured`
    - `payment.failed`
    - `order.paid`

6. **Implement Callback URL**

    Sites like Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Opera and UC browser do not support i-frame. You should implement [callback URL](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/callback-url.md) if your customers use any of these for making payments.

heading: Troubleshooting & FAQs
description: Troubleshoot common errors and find answers to frequently asked questions related to Razorpay Web Standard Checkout Integration.
---

# Troubleshooting & FAQs

### 1. Why are my customer payments being automatically refunded?

         Payments made without an `order_id` cannot be captured and are automatically refunded. Create an order using the [Orders API](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/integration-steps.md#11-create-an-order-in-server) before initiating payments.
         ```
        

    
### 2. What can cause an overflow issue on an HTML page, and how can I resolve it?

         Overflow issue can occur if the viewport meta tag is not present in your code. Check if the meta tag is added. If not, add the following line.

         ```html: View Port Meta Tag
         
         ```
        

    
### 3. Is a timeout applicable on transactions?

         Transaction timeout is applicable only when your customer attempts the payment. It times outs between 3 to 15 minutes. 

         The customer is redirected to the checkout if a payment fails due to timeout.
        

    
### 4. Can I track the status of the checkout modal?

         Yes, you can track the status of the checkout modal. You can do this by passing a modal object with `ondismiss: function(){}` as `options`. The `ondismiss` function is called when the modal is closed by the user.

         ```javascript: Javascript
         var options = {
             "key": "", // Enter the Key ID generated from the Dashboard
             "amount": "29935",
             "name": "Acme Corp",
             "description": "A Wild Sheep Chase is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami",
             "image": "http://example.com/your_logo.jpg",
             "handler": function (response){
                 alert(response.razorpay_payment_id);
             },
             /**
               * You can track the modal lifecycle by * adding the below code in your options
               */
             "modal": {
                 "ondismiss": function(){
                     console.log('Checkout form closed');
                 }
             }
         };
         var rzp1 = new Razorpay(options);
         ```
         You can utilise the `handler` function called on every successful transaction for tracking payment completion.
        

    
### 5. What is the difference between webhooks and callback URL?

         You can use Callback URL and webhook to get the status of the transaction for a payment source. 

         
         Particulars | Webhooks | Callback URL
         ---
         About | Webhooks allow you to build or set up integrations that subscribe to certain events on Razorpay APIs. When one of those events is triggered, we send an HTTP POST payload in JSON to the webhook's configured URL. 
 Know more about [webhooks](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/webhooks.md). | A callback URL is an address that a server provides, and any computer in the Internet/private network can POST data to it. For Razorpay integrations, callback URL is the address at which Razorpay should send the transaction response. You can pass the URL in the `https://` format in the `callback_url` request parameter. Know more about [callback URL](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/callback-url.md).
         ---
         When to use | Use webhooks to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur. For example, receive notifications upon payment failure.| Use callback URL to redirect your customers to a particular page. For example: 
 - You can send customers to a payment success page after successful payment. This page will receive payment details such as the payment id.
- The Razorpay Checkout pop-up page does not appear in certain browsers, for example, on Facebook and Instagram browsers. In such cases, you can use the callback URL to redirect customers from your Facebook/Instagram page to another page where the Razorpay Checkout appears. Customers can complete the payments on this redirected page.

         
        

    
### 6. How do I resolve a 500 internal server error?

         Multiple factors can cause a 500 internal server error. Ensure that the required features are enabled on your account. Additionally, verify that you are calling the API correctly. If the issue is still not resolved, contact our [Support team](https://razorpay.com/support/#request).
        

    
### 7. Is Razorpay Checkout supported on Internet Explorer?

         No, Razorpay Checkout is not supported on the Internet Explorer browser.
        

    
### 8. How can I enable customer information autofill at checkout?

         Customer information autofill is enabled by default for all businesses using Razorpay Standard Checkout. It prefills details like contact information, addresses and more, making the checkout process faster and smoother for your customers.
        

    
### 9. Can customers edit pre-filled information on checkout?

         Yes, customers can edit all pre-filled information based on their requirement.
        

    
### 10. Is the autofill feature supported on all platforms? 

         No, autofill is supported only on Instagram, Facebook and iOS browsers.
        

    
### 11. Can I accept payments through my Instagram page even if I do not have a website?

         Yes, you can accept payments without a website using Razorpay's no-code products such as [Payment Links](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-links.md), [Payment Pages](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-pages.md) or [Payment Button](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-button.md), as Razorpay does not offer a direct Instagram integration.
        

    
### 12. Are language-based SDKs available?

         Yes, language-based SDKs are available [here](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/server-integration.md).
        

    
### 13. The  netbanking    bank page is not opening on the Firefox browser. How to resolve this?

         Mozilla Firefox users may not be able to open the bank page while making a netbanking payment on your checkout. This issue may be due to a browser setting that blocks the webpage from opening a pop-up page.

         Your customers can follow these steps to unblock the pop-up page:
         - At **page level**: Modify settings on the bank page.
         - At **browser level**: Modify Firefox browser's settings.
         
         ### Page Level

         Modify the settings on your bank page. Follow these steps:
         1. Open Mozilla Firefox.
         2. Navigate to **Tools** → **Page Info** → **Permissions**  
         3. Set **Open Pop-up Windows** to Allow.
    
         ### Browser Level

         Modify the settings of your Firefox browser. Follow these steps:
         1. Open Mozilla Firefox.
         2. Navigate to **Preferences** → **Privacy & Security** → **Permissions**.
         3. Disable the **Block pop-up windows** option.
        

    
### 14. Which payment methods appear on Instagram/Facebook browsers?

         Payment methods like [UPI Intent](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/upi/upi-intent.md) and [Cards](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-methods/cards.md) will appear on Instagram/Facebook browsers. These browsers do not support any other payment method that opens on a pop-up page.
        

    
### 15. Can I enable UPI Intent in WebView on my app?

         Yes, you can enable UPI Intent in WebView on your:
         - [Android app](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/webview/upi-intent-android.md)  
         - [iOS app](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/webview/upi-intent-ios.md)
        

    
### 16. While using Razorpay UPI Intent, my customers are encountering this error, "Safari cannot open the page because the address is invalid." How can I resolve this?

         To resolve the error, request your customers to refresh the page and clear the browser cache.
        

    
### 17. How can I accept payments on my Android or iOS apps without integrating with the native SDKs?

         If you want to accept payments on your Android or iOS apps without integrating with our native SDKs, you can reuse your Standard Integration code. This approach opens the checkout form in a WebView within your mobile app. Know more about [Webview for Mobile Apps](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/web-integration/standard/webview.md).
        

    
### 18. How do I accept international payments on checkout?

         You need to enable the international payments feature on your Razorpay account. Refer to [international payments](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/international-payments.md).
        

    
### 19. What languages are supported on Razorpay checkout?

         Razorpay checkout fields support multiple languages, with English as the default. Customers can also choose Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali and Kannada. Know more about [checkout in local languages](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/features.md).
        

    
### 20. Can I switch between Standard Integration and Quick Integration?

         Yes, it is possible to easily switch from one integration method to another. If you were earlier using Standard Integration, you can switch to using [Quick Integration](https://razorpay.com/docs/build/llm-docs/payments/payment-gateway/quick-integration.md).

         - This is possible because the Standard Integration searches for the `data-key` field inside the `` tag, that when found, switches to automatic mode. 
         - It also creates a button alongside the `` tag and attaches its 'onclick event handler' (created internally) to the `.open` method of the Razorpay object.
